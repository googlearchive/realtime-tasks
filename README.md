# Collaborative Todos

[![Todos Screenshot](https://github.com/googledrive/realtime-tasks/raw/master/screenshot.png)](http://googledrive.github.com/realtime-tasks)

## Overview

A simple todo list based off [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/), [AngularJS](https://www.angularjs.org),
and the [Google Drive Realtime API](https://developers.google.com/drive/realtime).

You can try out the app on its [live instance](http://googledrive.github.com/realtime-tasks).

## Installation and Configuration

The project can run on any static web server.

## Building from source

If you don't already have [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), and [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) you can install with:

    npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower

Fetch the source for the app:

    git clone https://github.com/googledrive/realtime-tasks.git
    cd realtime-tasks
    npm install
    bower install

### Create a Google APIs project and Activate the Drive API

First, you need to activate the Drive API for your app. You can do it by configuring your API project in the Google APIs Console.

- Create an API project in the [Google APIs Console](https://developers.google.com/console).
- Select the "Services" tab and enable the Drive API.
- Select the "API Access" tab in your API project, and click "Create an OAuth 2.0 client ID".
- In the Branding Information section, provide a name for your application (e.g. "Realtime Cube"), and click Next. Providing a product logo is optional.
- In the Client ID Settings section, do the following:
  - Select Web application for the Application type
  - Click the more options link next to the heading, Your site or hostname.
  - List your hostname in the Authorized Redirect URIs and JavaScript Origins fields.
  - Click Create Client ID.
- In the **API Access** page, locate the section **Client ID for Web applications** and note the **Client ID** value.
- List your hostname in JavaScript origins in the Client ID settings.
- Go to the **Drive SDK** page and copy the **App ID**.


### Setup your App information

You should now have your **Client ID** and your **App ID**.  Update the `CONFIG` object in `app.js` appropriately.

### Deploy, run that's it!

You can run a local server with grunt:

    grunt server
